# testjava
 Main branch - support for running the app with a mocked destination. teh implementation is based on CAP examples and not using .env files to save some of the configuration
Remote OData branch - Add additional configuration to run with a real destination. In order to run the example I had to remove the API_BUSINESS_PARTNER from the destination path.
